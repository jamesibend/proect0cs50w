		<h1>Full Body Routines</h1>

		<h2>What is a Full Body Routine?</h2>

		<p>A full body routine as the title implies, involves working on each of the large muscle groups in any given training session. This means you won't be doing very specific isolation exercises to target individual muscles for the most part. Instead the focus will be on maximising compound movements (exercises which use multiple muscles and/or muscle groups) in every session. This doesn't mean every workout has to be exactly the same, some variation is important (and keeps things fresh) but variation will be more limited than in some other programs such as PPL.</p>

		<h2>Who is a full body routine best suited for? </h2>

		<p>Full body routines are generally best suited for those wanting to train less than four times per week. By training full-body you get maximum bang for your buck from a time-investment point of view. Once training more three times a week it becomes difficult to recover between sessions if you are running a full-body routine. Recovering from the muscle damage provided in the previous workout is key in preventing injury and not overwhelming your central nervous system.</p>

		<p>Beginners in particular are well suited to full body routines. Early on, beginners are particularly susceptable to DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). Using a full body routine allows around 48-72 hours to recover between sessions. Additionally, as these routines focus on compound movements like the squat, deadlift and bench press, it means you get to practice these movements more regularly and become proficient in them. Proficiency in compound movements can be the most beneficial step towards achieving gains in the gym.</p>

		<h2>What are some examples of full body routines? </h2>

		<p>There are various full body routines that people have used over the years. These go all the way back to the beginner days of Arnold Schwarzennegger where he recommended his 'Golden Six' routine to new trainee's. It's worth noting that Arnold had a previous background in powerlifting, providing a good strength base to start this kind of routine on.</p>

		<h3>Stronglifts 5x5 </h3>

		<p>A more modern routine which has seen a lot of use in recent years is Stronglifts 5x5. This is seen as a good base for new trainee's looking to quickly build up a strength-base in compound movements to carry on into a more advanced program down the line. This routine is run three times per week in a workout-rest day formula. Below is an example of a two week version of this routine in practice.</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Week 1</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Monday</th>
				<th>Tuesday</th>
				<th>Wednesday</th>
				<th>Thursday</th>
				<th>Friday</th>
				<th>Sat</th>
				<th>Sun</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Workout A</td>
				<td>Rest</td>
				<td>Workout B</td>
				<td>Rest</td>
				<td>Workout A</td>
				<td>Rest</td>
				<td>Rest</td>
			</tr>
						<tr>
				<th>Week 2</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Monday</th>
				<th>Tuesday</th>
				<th>Wednesday</th>
				<th>Thursday</th>
				<th>Friday</th>
				<th>Sat</th>
				<th>Sun</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Workout B</td>
				<td>Rest</td>
				<td>Workout A</td>
				<td>Rest</td>
				<td>Workout B</td>
				<td>Rest</td>
				<td>Rest</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>Of course the day can change to fit your schedule. Ideally you would always run this routine three times per week and have a rest day between each workout to recover. Then make sure if you finish one week on workout A, you start the next on workout B (to prevent developing imbalances) and vice versa.</p>
